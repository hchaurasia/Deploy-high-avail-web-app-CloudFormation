# Deploy-high-avail-web-app-CloudFormation
This project automates the deployment of the application on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CloudFormation. The infrastructure is divided into separate stacks: one for the network setup and one for the application deployment. The goal is to provision, configure, and tear down the necessary infrastructure with ease.

roject Overview

This project uses CloudFormation to provision the following resources:

VPC with public and private subnets
Load Balancer to handle HTTP/HTTPS traffic
EC2 instances running the application
S3 for static content storage
CloudFront for content delivery
IAM roles and policies for security
The deployment is divided into two independent stacks:

Network Stack: Managed by the network team, this stack provisions VPCs, subnets, and security groups.

Application Stack: Responsible for provisioning the application components, including EC2 instances, load balancers, S3, and CloudFront.

Prerequisites

AWS account with appropriate permissions
AWSCLI Install awscli and configured
CloudFormation templates for both the Network and Application stacks.
Scripts to create, update, deploy and delete the stacks.
Spin up instructions
To spin up your infrastructure using the provided scripts, follow the steps below:

Make the script executable:
chmod +x <scripts.sh>

Create a new stack:
Use the create.sh script to create a new CloudFormation stack.
The script requires three parameters (such as StackName, ParameterFile, and TemplateFile). You will need to pass these parameters as per the instructions in the script.
./create.sh StackName ParameterFile TemplateFile

This script creates a new stack with the provided parameters. Make sure you include IAM capabilities
Update an existing stack:
./update.sh StackName ParameterFile TemplateFile

This script will update the stack with new configurations based on the changes in the parameter or template file.
Deploy a stack:
./deploy.sh StackName ParameterFile TemplateFile

The deploy.sh script checks if the stack already exists. If it does, the script will update the stack; if it doesn't, it will create a new stack. It very useful for automation like CI/CD pipeline
Tear down instructions
To tear down the deployed resources, follow these instructions:

Delete a stack:
./delete.sh StackName

Use the delete.sh script to delete a stack. The script only requires one parameter: the name of the stack you wish to delete.
